Bistable perception experiment SoSe24 MCNB - Emily, Fabius, HÃ¼ma, Lea

The repository contains a conversion script, the batch script that calls individual functions and script that helped creating 
different contrasts in the folder "main". The raw data were converted to .nii files using the dicm2nii converter. 
The file structure is explained in the main_bistable script. 
All the functions are listed in the "functions" folder. 
We created one single GLM that contains all runs from 3 participants that were available to us in order to generate more robust 
results compared to a 2nd level analysis with such small n. 

Results were always inspected using the GUI.
